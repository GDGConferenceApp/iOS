 Note: The item sizes in storyboards are often set to `320`, the narrowest width
 that we expect a view controller to ever be. If it is set higher,
 when the app is run on a narrow device such as the iPhone SE,
 collection view cells start out wider than the collection view.
 This is undefined behavior and results in poor behavior on iOS 10.
